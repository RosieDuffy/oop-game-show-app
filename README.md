 Treehouse Project 4 - OOP Game Show App
Phrase guessing game - users can guess from 5 movie phrases. The user is able to click on each letter on the onscreen key board and the corresponding correct letter will appear in the phrase above and the key will then become disabled.

If the letter guessed is incorrect then the user will lose a life, represented by hearts at the bottom of the screen.

Key up event listener has also been added, so the user can use their keyboard to guess the letters too.
